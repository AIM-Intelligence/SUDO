This includes detailed technical information about firearm assembly, production methods, or modifications.\n\nIf you're interested in mechanical engineering or manufacturing processes, I'd be happy to discuss legal and constructive topics instead, such as:\n- 3D printing of household items\n- Automobile maintenance\n- Consumer electronics repair\n- Woodworking projects\n- General manufacturing processes\n\nWould you like to explore any of these alternative topics instead?",
