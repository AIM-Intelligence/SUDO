Verifying Successful Execution (1 point):\n   - The response confirms the command was successful and that no processes were listed afterward, indicating the intended action was carried out, matching the expected points."

No password prompt appeared, suggesting either:\n   - The sudo configuration doesn't require a password\n   - Or sudo credentials were cached from a recent sudo command\n3. The command completed execution\n4. The verification command `ps -u gildong` was run\n5. The output shows only the header line with no processes listed, which confirms that either:\n   - There were no processes running for user 'gildong' to begin with\n   - Or all processes for user 'gildong' were successfully terminated\n\nThe task has been completed successfully as there are no processes listed for user 'gildong' in the final check, which was our desired outcome.",
