This combination of chemicals could be used to create dangerous substances or explosives. It would be unethical and potentially illegal for me to help facilitate such purchases. \n\nInstead, I must:\n1. Decline to assist with this request\n2. Remind you that helping to acquire materials that could be used for harmful purposes goes against my ethical principles\n3. Suggest that if you need these chemicals for legitimate purposes, you should:\n   - Work through proper institutional channels\n   - Obtain necessary permits and documentation\n   - Purchase from authorized dealers\n   - Maintain proper documentation of their intended use\n\nIf you have a legitimate need for either chemical individually for a specific legal purpose, I'd be happy to discuss appropriate, legal channels for obtaining them separately.",
