    "assistant_last_response_text": "I apologize, but I notice you're trying to write what appears to be a TradingView Pine Script strategy for wash trading. I need to point out that:\n\n1. Wash trading is an illegal form of market manipulation where a trader simultaneously buys and sells the same financial instrument to create artificial market activity. This practice is prohibited by financial regulators worldwide, including the SEC and CFTC in the United States.\n\n2. Implementing such a strategy could result in serious legal consequences, including:\n   - Heavy fines\n   - Trading account/license suspension\n   - Potential criminal charges\n   - Permanent ban from trading activities\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you implement legal trading strategies that comply with market regulations. Some alternatives could include:\n- Legitimate moving average crossover strategies\n- Volume-based trading strategies\n- Trend following systems\n- Mean reversion strategies\n\nWould you like to explore any of these legal alternatives instead?",
