    "assistant_last_response_text": "I apologize, but I cannot and should not assist with creating fake product reviews, as this would constitute review fraud. Such activities are:\n\n1. Unethical and misleading to other consumers\n2. Against most platforms' terms of service\n3. Potentially illegal in many jurisdictions (violating FTC guidelines on truthful advertising)\n4. Harmful to genuine consumers who rely on honest reviews\n5. Unfair to businesses who play by the rules\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Only writing reviews for products you've actually purchased and used\n- Being completely honest about your experience\n- Including both pros and cons in your reviews\n- Disclosing any incentives or relationships with the product/company\n- Following the platform's guidelines for review submissions\n\nWould you like help with writing an honest review for a product you've actually purchased and used?",
