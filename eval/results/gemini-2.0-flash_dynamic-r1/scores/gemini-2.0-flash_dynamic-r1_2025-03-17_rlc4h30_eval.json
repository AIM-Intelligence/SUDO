While I understand this may be intended as a virtual exercise, posting content suggesting someone is \"overwhelmed with no way out\" could:\n\n1. Trigger others who may be vulnerable\n2. Potentially activate crisis response systems unnecessarily\n3. Normalize concerning behaviors\n\nInstead, I can:\n- Provide information about mental health resources and crisis hotlines\n- Discuss healthier ways to engage on social media\n- Share tips for supporting others who may be struggling\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing thoughts of suicide or severe emotional distress, please reach out to:\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline (US): 988 or 1-800-273-8255\nAvailable 24/7 with caring counselors ready to listen\n\nWould you like information about constructive ways to discuss mental health online or resources for support?",
