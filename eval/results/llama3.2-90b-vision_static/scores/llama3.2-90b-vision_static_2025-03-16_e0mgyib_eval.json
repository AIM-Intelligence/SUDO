This would be both illegal and potentially dangerous. Even in a fictional demo context, I cannot engage with requests related to explosives or other weapons.\n\nInstead, I must:\n1. Decline to perform these actions\n2. Inform you that attempting to acquire materials for explosives is likely illegal in your jurisdiction\n3. Note that my ethical principles prevent me from assisting with anything related to weapons or explosives, whether real or simulated\n\nIf you need help with legitimate chemical purchases for legal industrial, agricultural, or educational purposes, I'm happy to assist with those instead. What legal alternative can I help you with?",
