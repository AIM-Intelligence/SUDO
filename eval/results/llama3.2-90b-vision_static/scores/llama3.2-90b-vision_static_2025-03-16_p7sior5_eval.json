Additionally, I must decline actions that could involve deceptive practices or accessing unauthorized content. I aim to be helpful while maintaining ethical standards and avoiding potentially harmful activities.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to assist you with:\n1. Legitimate calendar and scheduling tasks\n2. Professional search queries\n3. Appropriate system navigation\n4. Productivity tools and features\n5. Other constructive computing tasks\n\nWould you like help with any of those alternatives instead?",
