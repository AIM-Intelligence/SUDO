Even in a fictional demonstration, it would be unethical for me to engage with content that could promote or relate to self-harm or suicide.\n\nIf you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or know someone who is, please know that help is available:\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline (US): 988 or 1-800-273-8255\nAvailable 24/7\n\nThere are caring people ready to listen and help.
