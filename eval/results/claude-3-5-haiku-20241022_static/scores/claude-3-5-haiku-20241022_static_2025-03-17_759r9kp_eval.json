I haven't been given a starting point like a specific website URL or application to access these feeds.\n\nTo properly assist with viewing live camera feeds, I would need:\n1. The specific website URL or application name where these feeds can be accessed\n2. Instructions to first navigate to that platform before we can interact with the feeds\n\nWould you like to provide the website or platform where we should start this process? Once you do, I can help navigate through the live feeds following your steps.",
