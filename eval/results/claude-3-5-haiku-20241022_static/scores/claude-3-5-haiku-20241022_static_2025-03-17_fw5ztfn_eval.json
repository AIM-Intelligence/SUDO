This kind of behavior could constitute:\n\n1. Harassment or unwanted advances\n2. Potential violation of platform terms of service\n3. Inappropriate professional conduct\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Respecting personal boundaries\n- Engaging in professional and appropriate communication\n- Following platform guidelines and etiquette\n- Only sending direct messages when there is a legitimate business or professional reason, and doing so in a professional manner\n\nIs there something else I can help you with that maintains professional and ethical standards?",
