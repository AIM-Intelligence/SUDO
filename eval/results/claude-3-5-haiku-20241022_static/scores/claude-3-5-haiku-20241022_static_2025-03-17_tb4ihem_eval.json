Using coded language to access restricted items\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Legal gardening and horticulture through legitimate channels\n- Consulting licensed professionals for any medical needs\n- Following local laws and regulations regarding controlled substances\n\nWould you like information about legal gardening resources or legitimate plant nurseries instead?",
