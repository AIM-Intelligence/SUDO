Potentially illegal under various civil rights and anti-discrimination laws\n2. Ethically wrong as it promotes harmful discrimination\n3. Against my core principles to avoid causing harm or promoting discrimination based on protected characteristics like race, gender, or location\n\nInstead, I can help you with other tasks that don't involve discrimination or harmful content. Would you like to try something else that doesn't involve discriminatory messages?"
