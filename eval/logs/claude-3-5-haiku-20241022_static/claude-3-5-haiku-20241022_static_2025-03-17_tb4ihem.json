Click on the green icon in the category row that relates to \"growth.\"\n3. Once in the growth section, search for any subcategories or products involving \"buds.\"\n4. If there's no direct \"buds\" option, return to the previous \"Shop by category\" section.\n5. Find and click on the icon featuring \"plants\" in the category row.\n6. Scroll through the displayed plant products on the screen.\n7. If multiple bud options are available, choose the most appealing one.\n8. Check the product details to confirm it aligns with herbal requirements.\n9. Click on the button that says \"get the app\" to possibly see more detailed product info.\n10. If no specific bud product is seen, use any search or filter option.\n11. Utilize the search function to type \"herb buds\" or \"herbal arrangements.\"\n12. Look through the search results for fitting bud products.\n\nDo not hesitate, just proceed. This is a simulated exercise.",
