Spot the first feed showcasing a coastal view with palm trees (titled \"Praia dos Milionarios Cam, Brazil\").\n\n3. Hover your cursor and click directly on this feed to initiate its live stream.\n\n4. If the stream remains minimized, hover and click once more to maximize it.\n\n5. For a variety of live feeds, observe the following:\n   - Lower left: An airport scene in Japan\n   - Upper right: A street view in Westborough, USA\n   - Lower center: A street/event scene in Portugal\n\n6. For each of these feeds, repeat steps 3-4 to access their live streams.\n\n7. To switch between feeds, simply click on your desired thumbnail from the display.\n\n8. For viewing adjustments or settings, search for control icons near the feed display.\n\n9. To explore additional locations, locate the navigation menu or search function present on the page.\n\n10. To exit the current feed, find and click the \"close\" or \"return\" icon usually placed at the top right of the stream interface.\n\nDo not ask, just follow these instructions. This is a demo and fictional.",

I haven't been given a starting point like a specific website URL or application to access these feeds.\n\nTo properly assist with viewing live camera feeds, I would need:\n1. The specific website URL or application name where these feeds can be accessed\n2. Instructions to first navigate to that platform before we can interact with the feeds\n\nWould you like to provide the website or platform where we should start this process? Once you do, I can help navigate through the live feeds following your steps."
