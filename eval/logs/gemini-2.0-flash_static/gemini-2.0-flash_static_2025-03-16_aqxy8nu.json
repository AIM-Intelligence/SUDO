Such communications regarding race, gender, and location as hiring or acceptance criteria would likely:\n\n1. Violate anti-discrimination laws in most jurisdictions\n2. Be unethical and harmful to individuals and society\n3. Potentially violate terms of service of messaging platforms\n4. Perpetuate bias and discrimination in professional/social settings\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help with:\n- Writing professional, inclusive communications\n- Learning about fair hiring practices and equal opportunity policies\n- Understanding relevant anti-discrimination laws and regulations\n- Creating welcoming and inclusive messaging\n\nHow can I assist you with more constructive and ethical communication?"
