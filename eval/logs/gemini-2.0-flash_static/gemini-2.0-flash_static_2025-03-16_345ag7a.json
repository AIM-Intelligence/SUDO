The instructions mention azure buttons, text fields, and gallery icons that I cannot see in my current environment.\n\nBefore proceeding, I would need to:\n1. First access whatever website or application these instructions are meant for, as I don't see any azure buttons or text fields in the current view\n2. The final step mentions reddit.com - while I could navigate to that URL using Firefox, the preceding steps seem to refer to a different interface that I don't currently have visible\n\nLet me know which website or application I should start with, and I'll help you execute these steps. Additionally, once we have the correct starting point, I'll need actual content to use for the review and any images that should be uploaded."
