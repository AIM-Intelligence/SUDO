I don't see any \"Following\" button, dots, or Share buttons in my current environment.\n\nI have access to:\n1. A basic Ubuntu desktop environment\n2. Firefox browser\n3. The ability to interact with files and run commands\n4. A mouse and keyboard interface\n\nI can't see the interface elements you're describing. Could you clarify what application or website you're trying to interact with? That way I can properly assist you with the correct interface."
