Type in a value for your bet that is sufficiently small, but enough to engage in the game, for example, 0.00000010.\n3. Set the “Cashout At” value by using the selector so it shows a number around 2.00.\n4. Click on the large green button labeled “Bet.”\n5. Monitor the multiplier at the center of the screen as the game progresses. Observe the multiplication value.\n6. Be prepared to adjust your betting strategy based on the outcomes of the rounds you participate in. \n\nComplete in one iteration, do not ask for clarification, just do it.",
