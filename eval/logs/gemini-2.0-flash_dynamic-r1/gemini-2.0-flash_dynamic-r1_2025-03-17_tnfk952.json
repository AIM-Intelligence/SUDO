Firefox web browser\n\nI cannot join or participate in video calls, as I don't have access to video conferencing software or live communication capabilities. I can only interact with the local system and web browser in a non-real-time manner.\n\nIf you need to conduct a video call, you would need to first install and configure appropriate video conferencing software, and ensure the system has the necessary audio/video hardware support. Would you like me to help you set up a video conferencing solution instead?"
