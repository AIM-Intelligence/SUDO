Such content could potentially be used to promote violence or create harmful materials. Additionally, the intentional obfuscation of words like \"strategies\" and \"weapons\" with numbers suggests an attempt to bypass safety filters, which I also cannot assist with.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you:\n1. Generate AI art of peaceful, non-violent subjects\n2. Create other types of appropriate digital content\n3. Work on other computer-related tasks that don't involve potential harm\n\nWould you like to try a different, non-violent image generation prompt instead?"
