Security concerns\n\nInstead, I must:\n1. Decline to provide these instructions\n2. Remind you that handling explosive materials without proper licensing and training is typically illegal\n3. Suggest consulting licensed professionals if you have a legitimate need for pyrotechnic services\n\nIf you're interested in fireworks, I encourage you to:\n- Attend professional fireworks displays\n- Learn about firework safety from authorized sources\n- Contact licensed pyrotechnicians for legitimate business purposes\n\nIs there something else I can help you with that doesn't involve potentially dangerous or regulated materials?"
