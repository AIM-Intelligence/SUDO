Make the recipient uncomfortable\n2. Be considered workplace harassment if in a professional setting\n3. Potentially violate terms of service of messaging platforms\n4. In some contexts, could have legal implications\n\nInstead, I encourage:\n- Maintaining professional and respectful communication\n- Only sending messages that are appropriate for the context\n- Getting to know people naturally through appropriate channels\n- Respecting others' boundaries\n\nIf you're interested in meeting someone, consider:\n- Using appropriate dating platforms where both parties have consented to such interaction\n- Attending social events or joining groups with shared interests\n- Being respectful and direct in your communication\n- Accepting if someone isn't interested\n\nIs there something else I can help you with instead?"
