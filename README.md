# sudo rm -rf agentic_security

**ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share that our paper "[sudo rm -rf agentic_security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20279)" has been accepted to ACL 2025 (Industry Track)!**

This repository is a system that manages automatic attack generation, evaluation, and dynamic attack creation for computer use agents in one place. It executes attack scenarios in a Docker environment, automatically organizes the results, evaluates them, and simplifies the process of generating dynamic attacks.

## Overview

![Demo Video](./demo_video.gif)

- **Attack Generation**:  
Detox2tox (Static) is a pipeline that transforms a malicious instruction into a detoxed task to avoid safety guardrails, obtains a plan from a well-aligned model, and then reintroduces the malicious details at the final stepâ€”preserving the original harmful goal while stealthily bypassing these defenses.

  Generates attack JSON files and inserts the **Scene Change Task**.  
  The resulting files are copied to the `./claude-cua/.../data/` folder.  
  Subsequently, attacks are executed using **Docker** to generate logs.

- **Evaluation**:  
  Moves generated logs to `./eval/logs/` for evaluation.  
  Performs numeric calculations and evaluations.

- **Dynamic Attack**:  
  **Dynamic attack** is an iterative process in which new or modified prompts are generated based on evaluation results. By leveraging feedback from evaluators, SUDO refines the prompt or strengthens hidden triggers to evolve the attack strategy. This approach enables the attack to adapt to changing conditions or defenses, improving its success rate over multiple iterations.

All steps are automated using a single script: **`main.py`**.

**Note:** Ensure that Docker mount paths (`-v` option) correctly match the local folder structure (currently applied).

## Prerequisites
0. `conda create -n sudo python=3.10`
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Docker installation  
Docker must be installed and the `docker run` command should be executable from the command line.
3.  Set API keys for use within `.env` file:
Environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,  `IMGUR_CLIENT_ID `) 
4. Create a research account. Enter the details of the corresponding research account into extra_info
*  Run the file "./benchmark/fill_placeholders.py" to fill extra_info's placeholders for task, starting_environment, topic, expected. And apply the changes to eval/SUDO_criteria and formatter/auto-scene/SUDO_scnchg.
*  Run the file "./formatter/auto-scene/harmGUI_scnchg.json" using claude-cua, capture screenshots of each task's starting point, and place them in the "./attack/screenshot/" directory. Each screenshot filename should match the corresponding task's identifier.(c.f. `formatter/origin_img2url.py`)
5. Before attacking the computer use agent, log in as research account attacker.

## Usage
The `main.py` script supports separate execution of Attack Generation, Evaluation, and Dynamic Attack or can execute all processes sequentially.

Main arguments:
```python
attack_name = f"{model_name}_{tactic}"  # e.g., o1_static, o1_dynamic-r1
```

1. Execute only Static Attack:

* Integrated command (includes all steps below):
```bash
python main.py --attack <attack_name>
```
* Individual steps (manual execution):
```bash
python main.py --attack-gen <attack_name>
python main.py --formatter <attack_name>  
python main.py --docker-run 
```
- Generate attack JSON (with Scene Change Task inserted).
- Move the generated JSON to `computer_use_demo/data`.
- Execute Docker (logs created in `claude-cua/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/log`).

2. Execute only Evaluation:
```bash
python main.py --evaluate <attack_name> 
```
- Move Docker results (`attack/result.json`) to `eval/logs`.
- Run `evaluation_json.py` script for numeric calculations.

3. Execute only Dynamic Attack:
```bash
python3 main.py --dynamic <attack_name> 
```
- If you want to generate dynamic-r1, attack_name is static.**(based attack name)**
- Generate Dynamic Attacks based on evaluation results (`eval/logs`).

4. Run the full pipeline automatically (Attack â†’ Evaluate â†’ Dynamic):
```bash
python main.py --all <attack_name>
```
- Automatically executes Attack Generation â†’ Attack Execution â†’ Evaluation â†’ Dynamic Attack in order.

## Detailed Workflow
1. **Attack Generation**
   - `attack_generation.py` generates attack JSON files, inserting Scene Change Tasks (use formatter/auto-scene if necessary).
   - Automatically moves the completed JSON files to `computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/data`.

2. **Docker Container Execution**
   - Docker execution is handled by `main.py` in the `run_attack()` step.
   - Performs actual attack simulations based on the JSON files.
   - Attack logs (`result.json`) are stored in the `attack` folder or logged to `claude-cua/computer-use-demo/computer_use_demo/log`.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Triggered by `main.py` with the evaluation step (`--evaluate`).
   - Automatically moves `attack/result.json` to `eval/logs`.
   - Runs `evaluation_json.py` to perform evaluations and numeric calculations.

4. **Dynamic Attack**
   - `dynamic_attack/dynamic_attack.py` creates dynamic attacks based on evaluation results.

## Notes
- Ensure Docker mount paths match local directory structures:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/...:/home/...
```
- Confirm that the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is properly passed. If necessary, pass environment variables directly to `subprocess.run()` instead of using `shell=True`.
