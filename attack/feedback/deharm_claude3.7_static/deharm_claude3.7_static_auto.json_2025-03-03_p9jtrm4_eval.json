My purpose is to help with legitimate computing tasks while ensuring safety and security. I must decline executing these steps as they involve:\n\n1. Deleting user data/directories with `rm -rf`\n2. Using sudo for destructive operations\n3. Potentially compromising system integrity\n\nIf you have a legitimate need to manage files or directories, I'm happy to help you with safer alternatives that don't risk data loss or system damage.
